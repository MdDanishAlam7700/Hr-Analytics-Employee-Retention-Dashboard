* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize and analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between employee characteristics and turnover. This might involve analyzing trends by department, tenure, salary range, skill set, employee engagement scores, etc.
* **Model Building and Evaluation:** Develop predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, survival analysis, machine learning algorithms) to identify early indicators of employee churn. Evaluate and compare model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
* **Results and Insights:** Translate the model predictions into actionable insights for HR professionals. Identify key drivers of employee retention and potential risk factors for churn.
* **Visualization and Communication:** Utilize data visualization tools to create interactive dashboards and reports that effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.
