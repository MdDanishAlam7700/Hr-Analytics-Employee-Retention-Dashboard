# Hr-Analytics-Employee-Retention-Dashboard

##Purpose: This project aims to leverage HR analytics to build models and insights that predict and ultimately reduce employee turnover. By sharing it on GitHub, you contribute to the open-source community while gaining valuable feedback and collaboration opportunities.

**Project scope:**

* **Data Acquisition:** Explore and gather relevant employee data from various sources (e.g., HRIS, performance reviews, engagement surveys). This may include employee demographics, job roles, tenure, performance metrics, compensation, benefits, training records, and exit interview data.
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensure data quality by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Prepare the data for analysis by formatting, aggregating, and engineering new features.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between employee characteristics and turnover. This might involve analyzing trends by department, tenure, salary range, skill set, employee engagement scores, etc.
* **Model Building and Evaluation:** Develop predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, survival analysis, machine learning algorithms) to identify early indicators of employee churn. Evaluate and compare model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
* **Results and Insights:** Translate the model predictions into actionable insights for HR professionals. Identify key drivers of employee retention and potential risk factors for churn.
* **Visualization and Communication:** Utilize data visualization tools to create interactive dashboards and reports that effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.
* **Open-source contribution on GitHub:** Share your project code, data (where feasible), and documentation on GitHub to encourage collaboration and feedback from the community. This also serves as a portfolio piece showcasing your data science skills.

**Impact and Benefits:**

* **Reduced employee turnover:** By proactively identifying employees at risk of leaving, HR can implement targeted retention strategies (e.g., career development opportunities, competitive compensation packages, improved work-life balance initiatives).
* **Improved HR decision-making:** Data-driven insights can inform strategic HR decisions regarding talent acquisition, compensation, performance management, and employee engagement programs.
* **Open-source contribution:** Sharing your project on GitHub allows for valuable community feedback and contributions, potentially accelerating project development and enhancing its impact.

**Additional considerations:**

* **Data privacy and security:** Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations while anonymizing sensitive information if necessary.
* **Ethical considerations:** Avoid bias and discrimination in model development and interpretation.
* **Continuous improvement:** Monitor model performance and update it regularly with new data to maintain its accuracy and relevance.

This is just a starting point, and you can tailor the project scope and specific components to suit your interests, data availability, and desired learning outcomes. By sharing your HR analytics employee retention project on GitHub, you can contribute valuable insights to the field, generate feedback, and ultimately improve your data science skills.
